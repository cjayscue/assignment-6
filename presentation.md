# Information Retrieval Models

<aside class="notes">
Hey guys!  My name is Christiana Ayscue.  And my name is Sanjana Krishnan.  And we are going to be telling you about something that we do multiple times a day.

# Search
Search for **stuff**.

# What do we Search for?

Some Examples
> - Music
> - Text
> - Images
> - Audio
 
 
 <aside class="notes">
Some common examples of data that we search for all the time are music, text, images, and audio.

# What applications do we use to find what we are looking for?

> - Web Search
> - Desktop Search
> - Peer-to-peer search

<aside class="notes">
What applications do we use to find what we are looking for?  We can use web search engines such as Google, desktop search on our laptops, 
or peer-to-peer search, which simply means to ask another human being a question.

#Goal

<aside class="notes">
The goal here is pretty simple: to match information seekers with the information they seek.
It sounds like an easy process, but is it really?
</aside>

#Information Use

<aside class="notes">
The first thing to think about, is that that people experience information needs when they percieve gaps in their knowledge.

# Finding what we want

<aside class="notes">
As human beings, the way we search for information is not static.

# Berry Picking Model

This represents how we progress during our searches...

<aside class="notes">
Instead, we tend to search in the manner that this represented in this image. As we discover new or useful information during our search we 
our query is going to evolve and shift.

# Basics

**Basics**

<aside class="notes">
In a nutshell, we've shared with you all the basics of search.  Now we are going to take things to another, slightly more technical level.
</aside>

# Information Retrieval

**IR**

<aside class="notes">
A big piece of the search puzzle involves Information Retrieval.  What is this you may ask?  Well, according to SILS Professor Jaime Arguello, it is the science and practice 
of

# Developing/Evaluating

Developing & Evaluating

<aside class="notes">
developing and evaluating systems that match information seekers with the info this seek.  In other words, IR is a means to find the info or data that you want.

#IR Models

IR Models

<aside class="notes">
In the world of IR, there are a variety of information retrieval models.  However, we are only going to focus in on three important ones today.
</aside>

#IR Models
Those three are

> - Boolean Model
> - Vector Space Model
> - Probalistic Model


<aside class="notes">
Those three are the Boolean Model, the Vector Space Model, and the Probalistic Model.
</aside>


#Boolean
Exact Match

<aside class="notes">
First, let's check out the Boolean Model. The Boolean model returns what is called an exact match. 
Retrieval is therefore based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms.
</aside>

#Logical Operators

> - AND
> - OR
> - NOT

<aside class="notes">
The logical operators AND, OR, and NOT are used when creating queries (aka searches) and information returned is either relevant or non-relevant.
</aside>

#Boolean PROs

<aside class="notes">
The advantages to this model are that users understand why a document was retrieved, users can control how specific the queries are, and it is easy and fast for the system to process.

</aside>

#Boolean CONs

<aside class="notes">
On the flipside, the cons of this model are that users take full responsibility on query formulations, Boolean queries get very complicated if the information 
needs are precise, and there is no relevance score to refer to.  For the unexperienced searcher, using a Boolean query may not be very helpful.
</aside>

# Vector Space Model

<aside class="notes">
Our next model is the Vector space model.  This model assumes that the degree of matching between a query and retrieved documents can be used to rank-order documents, and
this rank-ordering corresponds to how well a document satisfying a userâ€™s information needs.
